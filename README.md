A simple app for speed drills with on the fly WPM change support and backwards speed drills.
Spreader determines the amount of time a word is displayed by showing a word of five characters or less based on the wpm chosen by the user. Longer words are displayed for a longer time to provide additional time to read.

cd to the spreader directory and run "./spreader.py"

Changing Settings
=================
Every setting can be changed within the program, except for the default text that appears on program startup. This text can be changed through modifying the settings.ini file. To reset the program to factory default, delete the settings.ini file.
